  <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Gather  all your ingredients.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic on stove over medium heat until well browned.</li>    
  <li>Step 3: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
  <li>Step 5: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
  <li>Step 6: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Step 7: To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.

  <li>Step 8: Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
